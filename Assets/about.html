<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, My name is Lucas and I am an enthusiatic web developer</p>

<p>I come from a family of teachers where we value knowledge and curiosity; and is that curiotisy that
   in lockdown drove me to get myself into geek like activities,
  such as board games and 3D printing and 3D design (also managed to design and 3D print
  a fully working bagpipe, very cool isn't it?). And that moment was the gateway to also get into web development
  and find out that I love doing it (jusyt like any other nerd like activity).
  This is why I want to help people to build great websites, to show the world who they are and what they do.
